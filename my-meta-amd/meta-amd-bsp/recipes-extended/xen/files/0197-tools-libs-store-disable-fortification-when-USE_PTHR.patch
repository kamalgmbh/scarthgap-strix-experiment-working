Subject: [PATCH 197/221] tools/libs/store: disable fortification when
 USE_PTHREAD is defined

The code that destroys the connection to xenstored terminates the read thread
by calling pthread_cancel() and pthread_join() e.g, by sending a cancellation
request and waiting for it to terminate.
The deferred cancelability of the read thread relies on the calls to function
read() that act as cancellation points.

When fortification is enabled, the function read() is replaced by its fortified
version, __read_chk(), which performs also buffer overflow detection checks.
However, in glibc 2.35, __read_chk() is not implemented to act always as a
cancellation point.
As a result, when fortification is enabled, due to the absence of cancellation
points, the cancellation request cannot be processed, pthread_join() waits
forever the read thread to terminate and the destruction path never completes.

Undefine _FORTIFY_SOURCE when pthreads are used, to ensure that the calls to
read() will always act as cancellation points.
